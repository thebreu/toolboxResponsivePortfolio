              <h3>Fridays On The Plaza</h3>
              <p>I was looking at the promotional work that our local library put up
              for the Friday On The Plaza event in Cheyenne and I felt that i could improve it.<br>
              My friend Bobby is playing at that event and is highly photogenic.
           <br>
           I took an image from Bobbys' facebook page, increased the contrast of the image and carefully created vector shapes
            from the shadows provided by the up in contrast. <br> I was quite pleased with the result!

            <h3>Seamore Eye Guy</h3>
            <p>This little guy was one of my challenges that I did for The Array School of Technology And Design. <br>
             We had to create a realistic image of something using only vector shapes in Sketch.
              <br> I was trying to find a use for the pencil tool in Sketch as there seemed to be very little use
             for it in designing. However, I found using the pencil tool and applying a fill to the path I created <br>
            made for an excellent texture that I was looking for in the Iris!</p>

            <h3>Login Mockup</h3>
            <p>The students at array were tasked with designing a login page for an application.
             I decided to go for a short and simple page that creates a sense of adventure within itself. <br>
           the jagged edges of the banner not only adds to the sense of adventure, but are also reminiscent of mountains.
            <br>The challenge of designing something with the mindset of having to create it afterwords really made me
           think about how to make it simple yet visually striking.</p>

            <h3>Wasabi Grill & Bar</h3>
            <p>I was approached by Wasabi Grill & Bar to do a redesign of their website. <br>
            Their previous website was created poorly and the images used were rushed. (top image)
            <br> I took their current logo and made them a custom vector image of their logo.
            I didnt want this issue to arise again.
          I also took into account that Wasabi was not some fast food resturant and their current logo did not represent the elegance and
        feel of thier actual resturant. <br>I recomended the use of the new color schemes for thier logo to better represent that.</p>
